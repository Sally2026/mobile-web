                <h2>Feedback on My Final Project</h2>
                <p>After completing the first draft of my final project, I asked three of my friends to review it and give me feedback.</p>

                <h3>Dilasa</h3>
                <p>Dilasa told me that she really liked my website, especially how I positioned the pictures. She also suggested that I add a line or some kind of separator between the footer and the slideshow, because both have white backgrounds and they looked visually attached. I saw her point and completely agreed with her.</p>

                <h3>Kyile</h3>
                <p>Kyile said she thought the colors on my website were very cute. She also pointed out that one of my pictures appeared more vertical than the others. I looked at the picture, saw what she meant, and fixed it.</p>

                <h3>Amanda</h3>
                <p>Amanda said she liked my website overall and thought it looked good, but she also mentioned the issue with the white footer blending into the white background of the slides. She agreed that adding a separating line would fix the issue. I agreed with her and made the change.</p>

                <h2> Takeaways from the Course</h2>
                <p> Mobile Web was a very beneficial class where I gained a lot of practical skills. One of the most important things I learned was how to build mobile-first websites, starting with the smallest screen and scaling up, which helped me understand how to prioritize content and ensure good performance across all devices. I also learned how to use the CSS Grid layout system, which was challenging at first. However, after practicing, I became much more comfortable with it and applied it to several projects, including my individual project for the IT Minor, our group project, and the final project for this class. It made organizing and aligning content across different screen sizes much easier.</p>
                <p>In addition to CSS Grid, I learned how to use Bootstrap to quickly create responsive designs utilizing its grid system and built-in components. I also worked with the srcset attribute to serve different images based on screen size, which helped improve loading times and mobile optimization. I became comfortable using media queries to fine-tune designs for different devices and screen widths, which is an essential part of responsive web development. Another useful tool I was exposed to was SCSS, which allows for writing cleaner and more maintainable CSS with features like nesting and variables. While I’m still becoming familiar with SCSS, I’m eager to learn more so I can confidently use it in future projects.</p>
                <p>I also appreciated the topics we covered in the last four lectures, especially those related to the behind-the-scenes aspects of building a website. Learning about web hosting, domains, and deployment helped me understand what happens after the coding is done. These lessons were very beneficial because I’ve always been curious about how websites actually go live and function on the internet. I still plan to explore these areas more deeply to build a stronger understanding. </p>
