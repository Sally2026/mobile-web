                <h2>Feedback on My Final Project</h2>
                <p>After completing the first draft of my final project, I asked three of my friends to review it and give me feedback.</p>

                <h3>Dilasa</h3>
                <p>Dilasa told me that she really liked my website, especially how I positioned the pictures. She also suggested that I add a line or some kind of separator between the footer and the slideshow, because both have white backgrounds and they looked visually attached. I saw her point and completely agreed with her.</p>

                <h3>Kyile</h3>
                <p>Kyile said she thought the colors on my website were very cute. She also pointed out that one of my pictures appeared more vertical than the others. I looked at the picture, saw what she meant, and fixed it.</p>

                <h3>Amanda</h3>
                <p>Amanda said she liked my website overall and thought it looked good, but she also mentioned the issue with the white footer blending into the white background of the slides. She agreed that adding a separating line would fix the issue. I agreed with her and made the change.</p>

                <h2> Takeaways from the Course</h2>
                <p> Mobile Web was a very beneficial class, and I gained a lot of valuable skills throughout the semester. One of the most useful lessons for me was learning the CSS Grid layout system. Although it was a bit challenging to understand at first, I spent time practicing and experimenting with it until I became more comfortable. Once I understood how it worked, I was able to apply it immediately in my individual project for my IT Minor class, which made designing and organizing the layout much easier. I also used CSS Grid in our group project for the IT Minor and again in the final project for this class.</p>
